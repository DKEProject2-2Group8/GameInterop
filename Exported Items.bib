	abstract = {This paper describes an autonomous exploration algorithm for mobile robots. The method implements a frontier-based exploration strategy that relies on a reactive navigation system and a SLAM algorithm. Despite its strong biological inspiration, the navigation method is specially well suited for the exploration task since it is able to accept and follow higher level position targets while guaranteeing the integrity of the robot. The SLAM module is intended for online execution, but it is able to solve the entire path of the robot in real-time. The hierarchical nature of the SLAM algorithm allows for drift modeling and reduction, which achieves very good resolution maps directly from laser measurements, without extracting landmarks or correction steps. The exploration strategy attempts to exploit the benefits of both the mapping and the navigation algorithms, providing a basic framework for more sophisticated autonomous behaviors.},

	abstract = {Thanks to advances in both computer science and engineering, the divide between robotics and multi-agent systems is shrinking. Robots are capable of performing an ever wider range of tasks, and there is an increasing need for solutions to high-level problems such as multi-agent coordination. In this paper we examine the problem of finding a robust exploration strategy for a team of mobile robots that takes into account communication limitations. We propose four performance metrics to evaluate and compare existing multi-robot exploration algorithms, and present a role-based approach in which robots either act as explorers or as relays. The result is a complete exploration of the environment in which information is efficiently returned to a central command centre, which is particularly applicable to the domain of rescue robotics.},
